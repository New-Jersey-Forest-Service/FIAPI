FIA data for New Jersey was downloaded from three different collection periods. First between 2004-2008 (2008.csv), second for 2009-2013 (2013.csv), and third for 2012-2017 (2017.csv). Data was downloaded from the U.S. Forest Service EVALIDator version 1.8.0.00 and selected for only New Jersey during the previously mention collection periods. This data consists of all New Jersey FIA plots CN’s (identification number) as well as longitude and latitude coordinates of each plot. For each of the data year csv’s (2008, 2013, 2017) the data was projected in ArcGIS and spatially joined to the Highlands property boundary. During the spatial join, data that was within the Highlands property boundary or within half a mile of the boundary was clipped and exported as a new layer. With these three new layers: (2008Pinelands.csv, 2013Pinelands.csv, and 2017Pinelands.csv) The pinelands commission can use the NJ specific EVALIDator workbook, input the file path of either the 2008Pinelands.csv, 2013Pinelands.csv or 2017Pinelands.csv to query specific metrics of interest of FIA plots within their property boundary.
