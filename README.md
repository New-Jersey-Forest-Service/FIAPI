# FIAPI
Applications and Libraries for USDA Forest Service, FIA Program's EVALIDator


FIAPI provides webscraping capabilities for EVALIDator queries using Python 2.7 or R. This library follows the protocol released by FIA deatiling protocols for retreiving queries by building HTML strings directly (Miles 2015).

Python functionality is provided using the BeautifulSoup package, while the R version utilizes the library Rvest.
